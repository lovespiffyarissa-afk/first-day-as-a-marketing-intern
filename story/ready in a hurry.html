		<h1>First Day as a Marketing Intern</h1>
		<p>You decided to get ready in a hurry. you leave the house by 8:15am to catch the train. The train had many delays, so you didn't get to work until 9:30am, a whole hour and a half after you're supposed to be there. Your new boss pulled you aside for a chat. She understood where you were coming from and decided to give you a one time pass, but made sure to make it clear, being late is not acceptable. The next time you're late, you'll be fired. Your boss dismissed you and you feel like all you want to do is cry after that interaction.</p>
