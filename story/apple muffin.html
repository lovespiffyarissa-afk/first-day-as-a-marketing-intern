		<h1>First Day as a Marketing Intern</h1>
		<p>You decided to bring your boss an apple muffin. She took the muffin from you and thanked you. She took a bite, but quickly spitted it out! "Is this apple?!?!" she exclaimed "I hate apples!" she said. You instantly felt bad and started apologizing. She reassured you that she isn't mad at you, but you can't help to feel that you're already off to a bad start at your internship.</p>
